# General
- Prefer failing fast over capturing exceptions and continuing execution.
- Use pure functions where possible.
- Prefer protocols over inheritance.
- Use pathlib instead of os.path for file path manipulations.
- Use napoleon-type docstrings for documenting functions and classes.
- Use type hints for function signatures. Do not put types into the docstrings.
